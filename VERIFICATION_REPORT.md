# Orchestrator Scaffold Verification Report

**Date**: 2025-10-09  
**Task**: Verify Scaffold and Assign Next Tasks  
**Status**: ❌ VERIFICATION FAILED - STOPPING AS INSTRUCTED

---

## Executive Summary

**All required orchestrator scaffold files are missing from the repository.** The verification task cannot proceed to Task 2 (deployment and integration) until the scaffold from the previous PR/task is properly created and committed.

- [ ] .github/CODEOWNERS
- [ ] .github/workflows/codeql.yml

## Current Repository State

- **Repository**: gcolon75/Project-Valine
- **Branch**: copilot/verify-scaffold-and-assign-tasks
- **Last Commit**: 2d521cd "Initial plan"
- **Working Directory**: Clean, no uncommitted changes

## Task 2 Status: BLOCKED

Cannot proceed with the following Task 2 items until scaffold is in place:

### Blocked Tasks:
- [ ] Deployment Readiness
  - Cannot install dependencies (requirements.txt missing)
  - Cannot run sam build (template.yaml missing)
  - Cannot deploy orchestrator (all files missing)

- [ ] Integration Setup
  - Cannot configure Discord endpoint (discord_handler.py missing)
  - Cannot configure GitHub webhook (github_webhook.py missing)
  - Cannot register Discord commands (orchestrator not created)

- [ ] End-to-End Testing
  - Cannot test /plan command (Discord handler missing)
  - Cannot test GitHub webhook (webhook handler missing)

- [ ] Begin Orchestrator Logic Implementation
  - Cannot implement graph.py methods (file doesn't exist)
  - Cannot enhance discord_handler.py (file doesn't exist)
  - Cannot implement github.py functions (file doesn't exist)
  - Cannot persist runs in DynamoDB (run_store.py doesn't exist)

---

## Recommended Actions

### Immediate Next Steps:

1. **Locate or Create the Orchestrator Scaffold**
   - Check if there's a previous PR with these files
   - If not, create the orchestrator scaffold according to the task description
   - Ensure all files are created in the correct directory structure

2. **Create Missing GitHub Files**
   - Add .github/pull_request_template.md
   - Add .github/CODEOWNERS
   - Add .github/workflows/codeql.yml

3. **Commit and Verify**
   - Commit all scaffold files
   - Re-run this verification
   - Confirm all files match the intended scaffold

4. **Then Proceed to Task 2**
   - Only after all files are verified present and correct
   - Follow the deployment readiness checklist
   - Begin integration setup and testing

---

## Notes

- This verification was performed according to the problem statement instructions
- The task specifically stated: "If any verification step fails, STOP and report exactly which file(s) or integration(s) are incorrect or missing"
- All files are missing, therefore stopping before attempting any deployment or integration work
- The next most critical engineering step is **creating the orchestrator scaffold**, not implementation or testing
