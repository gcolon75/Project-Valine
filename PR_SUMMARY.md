## Feature 1: Client Deploy Enhancements

### What Changed
- Client Deploy workflow now accepts correlation_id and requester inputs
- Run names include correlation info: `Client Deploy — <id> by <user>`
- Dispatcher discovers runs by correlation_id
- Handler supports wait=true for deferred responses with final outcome

### User Experience

#### Before (wait=false or no wait param)
```
User: /deploy-client
Bot: 🟡 Starting Client Deploy...
     Correlation ID: `abc123...`
     Requested by: johndoe
     ⏳ Workflow dispatched. Use /status to check progress.
```

#### After (wait=true)
```
User: /deploy-client wait:true
Bot: [Deferred response]
     
     [Follow-up 1 after 3s]
     🟡 Client Deploy Started
     Correlation ID: `abc123...`
     Run: https://github.com/.../actions/runs/12345
     ⏳ Waiting for completion (up to 3 minutes)...
     
     [Follow-up 2 after ~90s]
     🟢 Client Deploy Successful
     Correlation ID: `abc123...`
     Run: https://github.com/.../actions/runs/12345
     ✅ Deployment completed successfully!
```

### Benefits
- ✅ Precise tracking via correlation IDs
- ✅ Optional wait for completion (up to 3 minutes)
- ✅ Clear final outcome messages
- ✅ Backward compatible (wait=false unchanged)
- ✅ Automatic fallback if correlation not found

## Feature 2: Multi-Agent Orchestration

### What Changed
- Added agent registry with 4 initial agents
- Implemented /agents command to list agents
- Implemented /status-digest command for run aggregation
- Laid foundation for future agent coordination

### User Experience

#### /agents Command
```
User: /agents
Bot: 🤖 Available Orchestrator Agents

     Deploy Verifier (deploy_verifier)
     Verifies deployment health by checking GitHub Actions workflows,
     frontend endpoints, and API health.
     Entry command: /verify-latest

     Diagnose Runner (diagnose_runner)
     Runs comprehensive infrastructure diagnostics including AWS
     credentials, S3, CloudFront, and API endpoints.
     Entry command: /diagnose

     Status Reporter (status_reporter)

     Diagnose workflows.
     Entry command: /status

     Client Deploy (deploy_client)
     Triggers Client Deploy workflow with optional API base override
     and completion tracking.
     Entry command: /deploy-client

     Total: 4 agents
```

#### /status-digest Command
```
User: /status-digest period:daily
Bot: 📊 Status Digest - Last 24 Hours

     Client Deploy:
     • Runs: 5 (4 ✅ / 1 ❌)
     • Avg duration: 1m 25s
     • Latest: [success](https://github.com/...) (2h ago)

     Diagnose on Demand:
     • Runs: 3 (3 ✅ / 0 ❌)
     • Avg duration: 28s
     • Latest: [success](https://github.com/...) (45m ago)
```

### Benefits
- ✅ Clear visibility into available capabilities
- ✅ Aggregated metrics for workflow health
- ✅ Foundation for autonomous agent selection
- ✅ Extensible architecture for future agents

## Testing

### Test Coverage by Feature

**PR 1: Client Deploy Enhancements**
- ✅ Dispatch payload includes correlation_id and requester
- ✅ Run discovery by correlation_id in run-name
- ✅ Fallback to most recent run when not found
- ✅ Polling success scenario
- ✅ Polling failure scenario
- ✅ Polling timeout scenario

**PR 2: Multi-Agent Foundation**
- ✅ Agent registry returns list
- ✅ All agents have required fields
- ✅ Required agents exist
- ✅ Agent IDs are unique
- ✅ Get agent by ID (success and not found)
- ✅ Individual agent details validated
- ✅ /agents command output formatting
- ✅ /status-digest daily period
- ✅ /status-digest weekly period
- ✅ /status-digest default period
- ✅ /status-digest invalid period handling
- ✅ Run aggregation and statistics calculation

### Test Execution
```bash
cd orchestrator
python -m unittest discover tests/ -v

Ran 111 tests in 4.019s
OK
```

All tests pass consistently.

## Security & Reliability

### Security Measures
- ✅ Correlation IDs are UUIDs (not predictable or sequential)
- ✅ No secrets logged or returned in messages
- ✅ URL validation unchanged (HTTPS-only, no localhost/private IPs)
- ✅ Agent registry is read-only data
- ✅ No PII or sensitive data in aggregations

### Reliability Features
- ✅ GitHub API rate limit handling (403/429 with retry)
- ✅ Exponential backoff on rate limits
- ✅ Per-call timeout ≤ 10s
- ✅ Polling total timeout ≤ 180s
- ✅ Graceful fallback when correlation not found
- ✅ All inputs sanitized and validated

## Backward Compatibility

### Guarantees
- ✅ `/deploy-client` without wait parameter: unchanged behavior
- ✅ Existing workflow_dispatch calls: compatible (new inputs optional)
- ✅ Existing push triggers: unaffected
- ✅ All new commands are additive
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing commands

### Migration Path
No migration needed. All changes are backward compatible with sensible defaults.

## Deployment Guide
