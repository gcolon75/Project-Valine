# Project Valine â€” Fixed Client

A drop-in React + Vite client with the routes you referenced:

- `/login`
- `/auth/artist`
- `/auth/observer`

## Quickstart

```bash
npm install
npm run dev   # opens on http://localhost:3000
```

## Notes

- Both `npm run dev` and `npm start` work (they run Vite).
- Build with `npm run build`, preview with `npm run preview`.
- Edit pages in `src/pages/` and routes in `src/App.jsx`.
