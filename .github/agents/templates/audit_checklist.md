## Common Issues and Fixes

### Accessibility Issues

**Issue:** Focus not visible  
**Fix:** Ensure `focus:ring-*` or custom focus styles applied

**Issue:** Color contrast too low  
**Fix:** Use darker/lighter shades, check with Chrome DevTools

**Issue:** Form labels not associated  
**Fix:** Add `htmlFor` to label and `id` to input (must match)

### Performance Issues

**Issue:** Bundle size increased significantly  
**Fix:** Lazy-load components, split code, review dependencies

**Issue:** Layout shift on page load  
**Fix:** Set explicit width/height on images, reserve space for dynamic content

### Responsive Issues

**Issue:** Horizontal scroll on mobile  
**Fix:** Use `max-w-full` and `overflow-hidden` where appropriate

**Issue:** Text too small on mobile  
**Fix:** Use responsive text sizes (`text-sm md:text-base`)

**Issue:** Touch targets too small  
**Fix:** Increase to at least 48x48px (use `p-3` or larger)

## Severity Guidelines

Use these guidelines to prioritize issues:

### Critical (Must Fix Before Merge)
- ‚ùå Breaks existing functionality
- ‚ùå WCAG Level A violations (keyboard trap, missing alt text)
- ‚ùå Console errors in production
- ‚ùå Build fails

### High (Should Fix Before Merge)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è WCAG Level AA violations (contrast < 4.5:1)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Performance regression > 10%
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Major responsive issues
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Keyboard navigation broken

### Medium (Fix if Time Permits, or in Follow-up)
- üí° WCAG Level AAA considerations
- üí° Minor responsive tweaks
- üí° Performance optimization opportunities
- üí° Code quality improvements

### Low (Nice to Have)
- ‚ú® Visual polish
- ‚ú® Animation enhancements
- ‚ú® Additional browser support (older versions)
