## Blockers Detail

### Critical Blockers

1. **Access to ghawk75-ai-agent Repository**
   - **Need**: Read/write access or at minimum ability to create PRs
   - **Impact**: Cannot migrate orchestrator code to canonical location
   - **Requested Action**: Repository owner grants access

2. **AWS Credentials**
   - **Need**: AWS access key ID and secret access key with permissions for:
     - CloudFormation
     - Lambda
     - API Gateway
     - DynamoDB
     - IAM (for SAM role creation)
     - CloudWatch Logs
   - **Impact**: Cannot deploy orchestrator infrastructure
   - **Requested Action**: Provide AWS credentials or deploy manually

3. **Discord Credentials**
   - **Need**:
     - Discord Application ID
     - Discord Bot Token  
     - Discord Public Key
   - **Impact**: Cannot integrate with Discord or test slash commands
   - **Requested Action**: Provide Discord credentials

4. **GitHub Credentials**
   - **Need**:
     - GitHub Personal Access Token with repo scope
     - GitHub Webhook Secret (can be generated)
   - **Impact**: Cannot integrate with GitHub or test webhooks
   - **Requested Action**: Provide GitHub PAT and webhook secret

### What Was Accomplished Without These

Despite blockers, we successfully:
- ✅ Verified all orchestrator code quality
- ✅ Confirmed no security issues in code
- ✅ Enhanced Project-Valine guardrails (CodeQL now includes Python)
- ✅ Created comprehensive documentation for consolidation
- ✅ Prepared CI/CD workflow template
- ✅ Documented exact steps for migration and deployment

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (For Repository Owner)

1. **Grant Access**: Provide access to ghawk75-ai-agent repository
   - Create PR with orchestrator code
   - Set up CI/CD workflow
   
2. **Gather Credentials**: Collect all required credentials
   - Discord: Application settings in Discord Developer Portal
   - GitHub: Generate PAT in GitHub Settings > Developer Settings
   - AWS: IAM user with deployment permissions
   - Generate webhook secret: `openssl rand -hex 32`

3. **Follow Migration Plan**: Execute phases 2-4 from ORCHESTRATOR_CONSOLIDATION.md
   - Copy code to ghawk75-ai-agent
   - Remove from Project-Valine
   - Update documentation

4. **Deploy**: Execute phases 5-6
   - Deploy to AWS with SAM
   - Configure Discord and GitHub integrations
   - Test PING challenge

5. **Verify**: Execute phase 8
   - Test all slash commands
   - Verify webhook delivery
   - Check CloudWatch logs

### Optional Enhancements

1. **Add Tests**: Create pytest test suite in ghawk75-ai-agent/orchestrator/tests/
2. **Enable Monitoring**: Set up CloudWatch alarms and dashboard
3. **Add Logging**: Enhance structured logging in Lambda functions
4. **Cost Optimization**: Review Lambda memory settings and DynamoDB capacity

## Cost Estimate

Based on orchestrator architecture (from IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md):

### Development Environment
- Lambda: ~$0.20-1.00/month (low usage)
- API Gateway: ~$0.50-2.00/month
- DynamoDB: ~$0.00 (free tier eligible with PAY_PER_REQUEST)
- CloudWatch Logs: ~$0.50-1.00/month
- **Total**: ~$1-5/month for dev

### Production Environment  
- Depends on usage volume
- Estimate: $5-20/month for moderate usage
- Can optimize with Lambda reserved concurrency and log retention policies

## Testing Plan (When Unblocked)

### Test 1: Discord /plan Command
1. Open Discord server where bot is installed
2. Type `/plan` in any channel
3. **Expected**: Bot responds with plan creation message
4. **Verify**: CloudWatch logs show successful execution
5. **Verify**: DynamoDB contains new run entry

### Test 2: Discord /status Command
1. Type `/status` in Discord
2. **Expected**: Bot responds with current run status
3. **Verify**: CloudWatch logs show successful execution

### Test 3: GitHub Webhook
1. Create test issue in Project-Valine with `ready` label
2. **Expected**: GitHub webhook delivers event (200 OK)
3. **Verify**: CloudWatch logs show event processing
4. **Verify**: DynamoDB updated with issue information

### Test 4: End-to-End Workflow
1. Create issue with `ready` label
2. Use /plan to create plan
3. Verify plan appears in Discord thread
4. Use /approve to approve plan
5. Verify workflow execution begins
6. Check all CloudWatch logs for errors

## Security Posture

### ✅ Current Security Measures
- No secrets in git history
- samconfig.toml excluded from git
- Configuration templates use placeholders only
- IAM roles use least privilege (DynamoDB access only)
- API Gateway requires signature verification (Discord, GitHub)
- Secrets passed as CloudFormation parameters

### 🔄 Recommended for Production
- Use AWS Secrets Manager for credential storage
- Enable AWS WAF on API Gateway
- Deploy Lambda functions in VPC
- Enable AWS X-Ray tracing
- Set up AWS Config rules
- Implement secret rotation schedule
- Enable CloudTrail for audit logging
