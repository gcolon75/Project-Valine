## AUDIT FINDINGS

### Repository Documentation Stats
- Total Markdown Files: 632
- docs/ directory: 5.6 MB
- archive/ directory: 416 KB
- scripts/ directory: 1.4 MB  
- orchestrator/ directory: 3.3 MB

### Issues Identified
1. ✅ FIXED: README.md broken reference to COMPREHENSIVE_SUMMARY.md
2. ⚠️  Multiple summary files with overlapping content (historical)
3. ⚠️  Some deployment guides have similar content (keep for now)
4. ⚠️  Potential internal link breaks (recommend link checker)

### Issues NOT Addressed (out of scope for this task)
- Did NOT delete any duplicate files (kept for historical reference)
- Did NOT consolidate deployment guides (recommend future task)
- Did NOT run link checker (recommend as next step)
- Did NOT move files to archive (recommend selective archival)

## RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS

### Immediate (High Priority)
1. Review PROJECT_BIBLE.md for technical accuracy
2. Run link checker: markdown-link-check on all docs
3. Update docs/README.md with complete index

### Short-term (Medium Priority)
4. Consolidate deployment documentation
5. Review and update security documentation
6. Standardize documentation format/templates

### Long-term (Low Priority)
7. Archive additional outdated summaries
8. Improve documentation discoverability
9. Set up automated documentation testing in CI
