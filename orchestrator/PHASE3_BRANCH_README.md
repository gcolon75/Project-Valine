## Implementation Details

### Original Implementation (PR #26)

**Branch:** copilot/add-status-and-deploy-commands  
**Merged:** October 15, 2025  
**Commit:** a97b223 - "feat(qol): implement Phase 3 QoL commands with utilities and tests"

- `/status [count]` - Show last 1-3 workflow runs
- `/deploy-client [api_base] [wait]` - Trigger Client Deploy workflow
- `/set-frontend` - Admin command (feature-flagged)
- `/set-api-base` - Admin command (feature-flagged)
- `URLValidator` utility
- `TimeFormatter` utility
- `AdminAuthenticator` utility
- 41 new tests (88 total passing)
- Comprehensive documentation

### QA Validation (PR #27)

**Branch:** copilot/qa-checker-for-phase-3  
**Merged:** October 15, 2025  
**Purpose:** Added Phase 3 QA Checker agent prompt and validation tests

## Commits in This Branch

1. **750077e** - "Initial plan" (empty planning commit)
2. **9ac5ace** - "doc: add comprehensive Phase 3 verification document"
3. **0a83ec8** - "doc: add Phase 3 PR summary with complete implementation history"

## Test Results

All tests passing:
```bash
$ cd orchestrator && python -m pytest tests/ -v
======================= 88 passed in 2.24s =======================
```

Breakdown:
- ✅ 11 URL validator tests
- ✅ 9 time formatter tests
- ✅ 9 QoL dispatcher tests
- ✅ 12 admin auth tests
- ✅ 47 other existing tests

## Status

✅ **VERIFIED COMPLETE**

- Implementation: ✅ Complete (PR #26)
- Testing: ✅ 88/88 passing
- Documentation: ✅ Comprehensive
- Security: ✅ Guardrails in place
- Deployment: ✅ Ready for production

## Acceptance Criteria

All requirements from the problem statement are met:

### `/status` Command ✅
- Returns within ~10 seconds
- Shows last 1-3 runs with conclusion, relative time, duration, links
- Handles empty states gracefully

### `/deploy-client` Command ✅
- Acknowledges immediately with run link
- URL validation enforces https and security rules
- Invalid values rejected with clear messages
- Known limitation: Wait polling not fully implemented (documented)

### Security & Reliability ✅
- No secrets in logs
- Backoff and retries for GitHub API
- All tests passing
- Documentation complete

## Known Limitations

### `/deploy-client wait=true` Polling

**Issue:** Full polling not implemented due to Discord interaction timeout (3 seconds) and AWS Lambda architecture constraints.

**Impact:** User receives immediate acknowledgment and run link, but no follow-up message with final outcome when `wait=true`.

**Workaround:**
- User can check the provided run link
- Use `/status` command to check run status
- Feature provides immediate value with run link

**Future Enhancement:** Would require Discord follow-up messages or async polling service.
