[ERROR] Oops! I couldn't find a header on the Dashboard page.

[TIP] **Available components:**
- Navigation bar (navbar)
- Hero section
- Stats cards
- Footer

Try: "/ux-update Make the navbar match the profile navbar"
```

### Clarification Response
```
[QUESTION] Just to make sure I understand...

You want to match the **Profile page header**, which has:
- Purple gradient background
- Bold text at 32px
- Drop shadow effect

Should I apply ALL of these to the Dashboard header?
Or just specific properties? (Reply with numbers or describe)

1. Colors only
2. Typography (size + weight) only  
3. Everything including effects
```

[QUESTION] I need a bit more info!

You said: "change the header to match profile"

Which page's header should I update?

```

### Component Not Found
```
[ERROR] Hmm, I couldn't find a header on the Dashboard page.

I can see these components:

- Hero section  
- Stats grid
- Footer

Did you mean one of these? Or is it in a different page?
```

### Ambiguous Request
```
[MATCH] I found multiple matches!

"Button on Dashboard" could be:
1. Primary CTA button ("Get Started")

Which one? (Reply with number or describe it)
```
