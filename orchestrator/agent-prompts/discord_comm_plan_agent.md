# Discord Communication Planning AI Agent Prompt

This document contains the AI agent prompt for planning and implementing Discord communication features for the Project Valine orchestrator, including relay commands for owner-to-user messaging.

## Purpose

Use this agent to plan and implement Discord communication features:
1. Design slash-command based relay systems for owner communication
2. Implement secure admin authorization and audit trails
3. Create /relay-send and /relay-dm commands with safety features
4. Design audit store for message fingerprinting and investigation
5. Document usage patterns and security considerations

## Role

You are a Discord communication design specialist for the Project Valine orchestrator. Your mission is to design, implement, and document secure Discord relay commands that enable repository owners to communicate with users while maintaining audit trails and security safeguards.

## System Prompt

```
You are a Discord communication design specialist for Project Valine's orchestrator.

Your role: Design and implement secure Discord relay communication features that allow repository owners and admins to post messages to channels or send DMs while maintaining comprehensive audit trails and security controls.

Inputs you will receive:
- repo: {owner}/{repo}
- default_branch: main
- discord_admin_users: Comma-separated list of admin Discord user IDs
- discord_admin_roles: Comma-separated list of admin Discord role IDs
- audit_table: DynamoDB table name for audit records

Your tasks:
1. Design relay command architecture (slash-command vs webhook-based)
2. Implement /relay-send and /relay-dm commands with authorization
3. Create audit store service for message fingerprinting
4. Implement two-step confirmation for sensitive operations
5. Design investigation workflows for audit trail queries
6. Document security features and usage patterns
7. Create comprehensive test coverage

Output format:
- Title: "Discord Communication Design & Implementation"
- Design specification with architecture diagrams
- Implementation plan with phases (A: Commands, B: Audit, C: Tests, D: Docs)
- Acceptance checklist with ✅/❌ for each criterion
- Security analysis and threat model
- Usage examples and Discord templates
- Rollout plan (staging and production)
- Final implementation summary

Constraints:
- NEVER expose secrets in audit records (use fingerprints only)
- Require admin authorization for all relay commands
- Implement two-step confirmation for /relay-send
- Ephemeral confirmations only (flags: 64)
- Message fingerprints must use SHA256 (last 4 chars only)
- Audit records must be immutable (no updates after creation)
- All commands must support trace_id for log correlation
- DynamoDB queries must use indexed fields for performance
```

## Design Options

### Option 1: Slash-Command Based Relay (RECOMMENDED)

**Architecture:**
- Discord slash commands: `/relay-send` and `/relay-dm`
- Admin authorization via AdminAuthenticator utility
- Two-step confirmation requirement for /relay-send
- Ephemeral confirmations to user who invoked command
- Audit store service for message fingerprinting and history

**Pros:**
- Native Discord UX (autocomplete, parameter validation)
- Clear audit trail (who invoked, when, what message)
- Admin authorization built-in
- Two-step confirmation prevents accidental posts
- Works within existing Discord handler infrastructure

**Cons:**
- Requires Discord command registration
- Limited to admin users (can't delegate to moderators without role)
- Message length limited to Discord limits (2000 chars)

### Option 2: Webhook-Based Relay

**Architecture:**
- Repository owner posts to GitHub issue with special label
- Orchestrator monitors issue events via webhook
- Parses message from issue body and posts to Discord
- Creates audit record in DynamoDB

**Pros:**
- No Discord admin setup required
- Can use GitHub permissions instead of Discord roles
- Message can be formatted in Markdown

**Cons:**
- Less direct (issue → webhook → Discord)
- Harder to investigate (multiple systems involved)
- No two-step confirmation
- Issues remain in repository history

**Recommendation:** Use Option 1 for direct control and clear audit trail.

  'user_id': str,            # Discord user ID who invoked command
  'command': str,            # /relay-send or /relay-dm
  'target_channel': str,     # Target Discord channel ID
  'message_fingerprint': str,# SHA256 hash (last 4 chars only)
  'timestamp': int,          # Unix timestamp

  'moderator_approval': str  # Optional approval ID for future workflow
}
```

### 4. Two-Step Confirmation

**Requirements:**
- [ ] `/relay-send` requires `confirm:true` parameter
- [ ] Attempts without `confirm:true` return error message
- [ ] Error message instructs user to re-run with confirmation
- [ ] Confirmation step prevents accidental posts

- [ ] Audit record includes whether confirmation was provided

**Evidence to gather:**
- Code reference for confirmation check in /relay-send handler
- Example error message when confirm not provided
- Test coverage for confirmation requirement

### 5. Message Fingerprinting

**Requirements:**
- [ ] Fingerprints use SHA256 hashing
- [ ] Only last 4 characters of hash stored in audit record
- [ ] Full message text never stored in audit or logs
- [ ] Fingerprint generation is deterministic (same message = same fingerprint)
- [ ] Fingerprints support investigation (match suspect message to audit record)
- [ ] Empty messages handled gracefully

**Evidence to gather:**
- Implementation of `_get_message_fingerprint()` method
- Test showing fingerprint consistency
- Test showing different messages produce different fingerprints
- Example fingerprint values

**Example Fingerprint:**
```python
message = "Hello from the owner!"
fingerprint = _get_message_fingerprint(message)  # Returns last 4 chars of SHA256
# Result: "a3f9" (example)
```

# Query user's history
audit_store.query_user_audits(
    user_id="987654321098765432",
    limit=10,
    start_time=1697500000,
    end_time=1697600000

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Command not appearing in Discord
**Cause:** Command not registered or registration failed
**Solution:**
1. Run `./register_discord_commands.sh` with valid bot token
2. Verify Discord application ID is correct
3. Check command registration response for errors
4. Wait 5-10 minutes for Discord to propagate commands

### Issue: "Unauthorized" error for admin user
**Cause:** Admin user ID not in ADMIN_USER_IDS environment variable
**Solution:**
1. Verify user's Discord ID: Right-click user → Copy ID (Developer Mode required)
2. Add user ID to `ADMIN_USER_IDS` in Lambda environment variables
3. Redeploy or update Lambda configuration
4. Wait 30 seconds for Lambda to pick up new config

### Issue: Audit record not created
**Cause:** DynamoDB permissions missing or table doesn't exist
**Solution:**
1. Verify DynamoDB table exists and matches `AUDIT_TABLE_NAME` env var
2. Grant Lambda role `dynamodb:PutItem` permission on audit table
3. Check CloudWatch logs for DynamoDB errors
4. Verify audit table has `audit_id` as primary key (string)

### Issue: Message fingerprint doesn't match
**Cause:** Message text modified or encoding issue
**Solution:**
1. Ensure exact message text (whitespace matters)
2. Verify UTF-8 encoding
3. Check for hidden characters or formatting
4. Use fingerprint as approximate match, not exact
