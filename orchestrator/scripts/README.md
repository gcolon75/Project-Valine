# Orchestrator Scripts

This directory contains utility scripts for managing and validating the Project Valine orchestrator.

## Minimal Global Registration (Rin) - Current Standard

**Script:** `min_register_global.ps1`

**Platform:** Windows PowerShell 5.1+

**Purpose:** Simplest path to register `/ux-update` command globally using only APP_ID + BOT_TOKEN.

**Quick Start:**

```powershell
# Set environment variables
$env:STAGING_DISCORD_APPLICATION_ID = "1428568840958251109"
$env:STAGING_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN = "your_raw_token_here"

# Run the script
.\orchestrator\scripts\min_register_global.ps1

# Expected output:
# Bot OK: @RinBot (ID:1428568840958251109)
# GLOBAL: Created /ux-update
# Heads-up: Global commands can take up to ~1 hour to appear in Discord UI
```

**Important Notes:**
- ‚è∞ Global commands take up to ~1 hour to appear in Discord (tradeoff for simplicity)
- üîí Use raw token only (no "Bot " prefix) - script adds it automatically
- ‚úÖ Only 2 env vars needed (no GUILD_ID required)
