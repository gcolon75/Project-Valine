# ⚠️ MIGRATION NOTICE

## This Orchestrator Code Will Be Moved

**Current Location**: `gcolon75/Project-Valine/orchestrator/`  
**Target Location**: `ghawk75-ai-agent/orchestrator/`  
**Status**: ⏳ Migration Pending

## Why This Move?

The orchestrator code is being consolidated into a single canonical repository (`ghawk75-ai-agent`) to:

1. **Separate Concerns**: Keep product application code (Project-Valine) separate from orchestrator infrastructure
2. **Single Source of Truth**: Avoid duplication and confusion about which code is authoritative
3. **Better CI/CD**: Enable dedicated CI/CD pipelines for orchestrator without impacting product deployments
4. **Clear Ownership**: Establish clear ownership and maintenance responsibilities

## What This Means

### For Developers
- ✅ Current code is fully functional and ready to deploy
- ✅ All documentation is complete and accurate
- ⏳ After migration, refer to `ghawk75-ai-agent/orchestrator` for latest code
- ⏳ Project-Valine will only reference the orchestrator, not contain it

### For Deployment
- ✅ Can still deploy from this location until migration completes
- ⏳ After migration, deploy from `ghawk75-ai-agent/orchestrator`
- ⏳ Update any bookmarks or automation scripts to new location

## Migration Plan

See [ORCHESTRATOR_CONSOLIDATION.md](../ORCHESTRATOR_CONSOLIDATION.md) for complete details.

**High-level steps**:
1. Copy all files to `ghawk75-ai-agent/orchestrator`
2. Set up CI/CD in `ghawk75-ai-agent`
3. Remove orchestrator code from `Project-Valine`
4. Update Project-Valine documentation to reference new location

## Timeline

- **Current**: Code verified and ready for migration
- **Next**: Waiting for repository access and credentials
- **Estimated**: Migration can be completed in 1-2 hours once access is granted

## Questions?

See:
- [Consolidation Plan](../ORCHESTRATOR_CONSOLIDATION.md) - Full migration strategy
- [Status Report](../CONSOLIDATION_STATUS_REPORT.md) - Current status and blockers
- [README.md](README.md) - Orchestrator documentation (deployment still works)

## During Migration Period

**You can still**:
- ✅ Read documentation here
- ✅ Deploy from this location
- ✅ Test locally
- ✅ Review code

**Do not**:
- ❌ Make new features here (they'll be lost in migration)
- ❌ Update documentation here (update in ghawk75-ai-agent after migration)
