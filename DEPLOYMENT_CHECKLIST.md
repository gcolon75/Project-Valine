- [ ] Rollback procedure documented
- [ ] Database migration rollback tested
- [ ] Quick rollback command available:
  ```bash
  # Backend
  cd serverless && npx serverless deploy --stage prod --verbose
  
  # Frontend
  # Trigger previous version deployment
  ```

## Success Criteria

All of these should be true:

- [x] ✅ Backend API accessible at AWS API Gateway URL
- [x] ✅ Database tables created and queryable
- [x] ✅ All test API calls return expected responses
- [x] ✅ Frontend loads real data from backend
- [x] ✅ Profile page displays user information
- [x] ✅ Dashboard shows post feed
- [x] ✅ Connection requests functional
- [x] ✅ No breaking errors in production
- [x] ✅ CloudWatch logs show successful invocations
- [x] ✅ No security vulnerabilities exposed

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Database connection failed
- [ ] Verify DATABASE_URL format
- [ ] Check database allows connections from Lambda IPs
- [ ] Verify security group rules
- [ ] Test connection with psql/mysql client

### Issue: Module not found: @prisma/client
- [ ] Run `cd api && npx prisma generate`
- [ ] Run `cd serverless && npm install`
- [ ] Redeploy backend

### Issue: CORS errors in browser
- [ ] Verify CORS headers in handler functions
- [ ] Check API Gateway CORS configuration
- [ ] Test with OPTIONS request

### Issue: Lambda timeout
- [ ] Increase timeout in serverless.yml (default 6s → 30s)
- [ ] Check database query performance
- [ ] Consider Prisma Data Proxy for connection pooling

### Issue: Frontend shows "Loading..." forever
- [ ] Check browser console for errors
- [ ] Verify VITE_API_BASE in .env
- [ ] Test API directly with curl
- [ ] Check Lambda logs in CloudWatch

## Notes

- Keep this checklist updated as deployment process evolves
- Use for both initial deployment and updates
- Share with team members
- Document any issues encountered and solutions

## Estimated Time

- Development deployment: 30-60 minutes
- Production deployment: 1-2 hours (with testing)
- Subsequent deployments: 10-15 minutes
