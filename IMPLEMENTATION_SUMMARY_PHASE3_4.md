# Implementation Summary: Phase 3 Polish + Phase 4 Multi-Agent Foundation

## Overview
This implementation delivers two production-ready features for the Project Valine orchestrator:

1. **PR 1**: Enhanced `/deploy-client` with correlation tracking, deferred responses, and wait flow
2. **PR 2**: Multi-agent orchestration foundation with `/agents` and `/status-digest` commands

## PR 1: Client Deploy Enhancements

### Features Implemented

#### Correlation ID Tracking
- Every Client Deploy workflow dispatch now receives a unique correlation ID (UUID)
- Correlation ID is included in the workflow `run-name` for easy identification
- Format: `Client Deploy ‚Äî <correlation_id> by <requester>`
- Enables precise tracking and discovery of specific workflow runs

#### Workflow Inputs Enhancement
**File**: `.github/workflows/client-deploy.yml`
- Added `correlation_id` input (optional)
- Added `requester` input (optional) 
- Maintained existing `VITE_API_BASE` input
- Updated run-name to include correlation_id and requester with fallbacks

#### Dispatcher Updates
**File**: `orchestrator/app/services/github_actions_dispatcher.py`
- `trigger_client_deploy()`: Now passes correlation_id and requester in dispatch payload
- `find_run_by_correlation()`: Discovers workflow runs by correlation_id in run-name with fallback to most recent
- `poll_run_conclusion()`: Polls for workflow completion with configurable timeout (~180s default)
- Respects GitHub API rate limits with automatic retry (up to 2 retries)

#### Discord Handler - Wait Flow
**File**: `orchestrator/app/handlers/discord_handler.py`
- **wait=false (default)**: Immediate acknowledgment with correlation ID (unchanged behavior)
- **wait=true**: 
  - Sends deferred response (type 5) immediately
  - Posts follow-up "Starting..." message with run link once discovered
  - Polls for completion (up to 3 minutes)
  - Posts final outcome:
    - üü¢ Success: Deployment completed successfully
    - üî¥ Failure: Deployment failed with link to run
    - ‚è±Ô∏è Timeout: Still running after 3 minutes with status link
- Added `_post_followup_message()` helper for Discord interaction follow-ups

#### Testing
**File**: `orchestrator/tests/test_github_actions_dispatcher.py`
- Added 6 new tests covering:
  - Dispatch payload includes correlation_id and requester
  - Run discovery by correlation_id
  - Fallback to most recent run when correlation not found
  - Polling success, failure, and timeout scenarios
- All 21 dispatcher tests passing

#### Documentation
**File**: `orchestrator/README.md`
- Updated `/deploy-client` section with:
  - Correlation tracking behavior and benefits
  - wait=true flow and response timeline
  - wait=false default behavior
  - Guardrails and rate limit handling

## PR 2: Multi-Agent Foundation

### Features Implemented

#### Agent Registry
**Files**: 
- `orchestrator/app/agents/__init__.py`
- `orchestrator/app/agents/registry.py`

Defines four initial agents:
1. **Deploy Verifier** (`deploy_verifier`)
   - Verifies deployment health
   - Entry: `/verify-latest`

2. **Diagnose Runner** (`diagnose_runner`)
   - Comprehensive infrastructure diagnostics
   - Entry: `/diagnose`

3. **Status Reporter** (`status_reporter`)
   - Recent workflow run status
   - Entry: `/status`

4. **Client Deploy** (`deploy_client`)
   - Triggers deployments with tracking
   - Entry: `/deploy-client`

Each agent has:
- Unique ID
- Display name
- Description of capabilities
- Entry command

#### /agents Command
**Function**: `handle_agents_command()`
- Lists all available agents
- Shows descriptions and entry commands
- Returns formatted response with agent count

Example output:
```
ü§ñ Available Orchestrator Agents

Deploy Verifier (deploy_verifier)
Verifies deployment health by checking GitHub Actions workflows, frontend endpoints, and API health.
Entry command: /verify-latest

[... additional agents ...]

Total: 4 agents
```

#### /status-digest Command
**Function**: `handle_status_digest_command()`
- Aggregates workflow runs over a time period
- Supports `daily` (24 hours) and `weekly` (7 days) periods
- Calculates statistics:
  - Total runs with success/failure counts
  - Average duration
  - Most recent run with relative time
- Covers both Client Deploy and Diagnose workflows

Example output:
```
üìä Status Digest - Last 24 Hours

Client Deploy:
‚Ä¢ Runs: 5 (4 ‚úÖ / 1 ‚ùå)
‚Ä¢ Avg duration: 1m 25s
‚Ä¢ Latest: [success](https://github.com/...) (2h ago)

Diagnose on Demand:
‚Ä¢ Runs: 3 (3 ‚úÖ / 0 ‚ùå)
‚Ä¢ Avg duration: 28s
‚Ä¢ Latest: [success](https://github.com/...) (45m ago)
```

#### Command Registration
**File**: `orchestrator/register_discord_commands.sh`
- Added `/agents` command registration
- Added `/status-digest` command registration with period choices (daily/weekly)
- Updated command list in summary output

#### Testing
**Files**: 
- `orchestrator/tests/test_agent_registry.py` (10 tests)
- `orchestrator/tests/test_multi_agent_commands.py` (7 tests)

Coverage includes:
- Agent registry contents and structure
- Agent field validation
- Required agents existence
- Agent ID uniqueness
- /agents output formatting
- /status-digest period handling (daily, weekly, default, invalid)
- Run aggregation and statistics calculation

All 17 new tests passing.

#### Documentation
**File**: `orchestrator/README.md`
- Added "Multi-Agent Orchestration" section
- Documented all four agents
- Provided usage examples for `/agents` and `/status-digest`
- Explained extensibility approach for future agents

## Test Coverage

### Summary
- **Total tests**: 111 (all passing)
- **Test files**: 11
- **New tests added**: 23
  - PR 1: 6 tests for correlation tracking and polling
  - PR 2: 17 tests for agent registry and commands

### Test Execution
```bash
cd orchestrator
python -m unittest discover tests/ -v
```

All tests pass in ~4 seconds.

## Security & Reliability

### PR 1
- Correlation IDs are UUIDs (not predictable)
- No secrets in logs or user-visible messages
- Respects GitHub API rate limits (403/429 handling)
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Per-call timeout ‚â§ 10s, polling total ‚â§ 180s
- URL validation unchanged (HTTPS-only, no private IPs)

### PR 2
- Agent registry is read-only data structure
- No external API calls in agent listing
- Status digest uses existing GitHub service with rate limits
- No PII or sensitive data exposed in aggregations

## Backward Compatibility

### PR 1
- `/deploy-client` without `wait` parameter: **unchanged behavior**
- Existing workflow_dispatch calls: **compatible** (new inputs are optional)
- Existing workflows on main branch: **unaffected** (push trigger unchanged)

### PR 2
- No changes to existing commands
- New commands are additive only
- Agent registry doesn't affect existing functionality
