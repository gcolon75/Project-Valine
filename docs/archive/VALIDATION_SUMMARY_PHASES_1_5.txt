Total: 13 commands (12 registered + 1 feature-flagged)

WORKFLOWS IMPLEMENTED
---------------------
1. client-deploy.yml — Main deployment workflow with OIDC
2. diagnose-dispatch.yml — On-demand diagnostics with correlation
3. bot-smoke.yml — CI tests with lint, typecheck, security

DOCUMENTATION FILES
-------------------
1. orchestrator/README.md (935 lines) — Main documentation
2. orchestrator/RUNBOOK.md (560 lines) — Operations guide
3. orchestrator/QA_CHECKER_GUIDE.md — Automated validation
4. orchestrator/IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY_PHASE3_4.md — Phase 3-4 details
5. orchestrator/IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY_PHASE5.md — Phase 5 details
6. orchestrator/PHASE5_VALIDATION.md — Phase 5 validation
7. MASS_PHASE_VALIDATION_REPORT.md — This validation report

SECURITY FEATURES
-----------------
✅ Secret redaction in logs (shows last 4 chars only)
✅ Admin authorization with allowlists
✅ URL validation (HTTPS only, no private IPs)
✅ Feature flags for sensitive operations (default: OFF)
✅ CI security checks for leaked secrets
✅ OIDC for AWS credentials (no static keys)
✅ Repository/workflow dispatch with validation

OBSERVABILITY FEATURES
----------------------
✅ Structured JSON logging with trace_id
✅ Correlation tracking across workflows
✅ Trace store for debugging
✅ Alerts with rate-limiting and deduplication
✅ /debug-last command for troubleshooting
✅ CloudWatch Insights queries documented

NO BLOCKERS FOUND
-----------------
✓ All acceptance criteria met
✓ All tests passing
✓ Documentation complete
✓ Security implemented
✓ No missing features

RECOMMENDATIONS (OPTIONAL)
--------------------------
These are enhancements, not requirements:

1. Persistence for trace store (DynamoDB instead of in-memory)
2. Additional agents (PR reviewer, issue triager)
3. CloudWatch custom metrics for command usage
4. Pre-configured dashboard with common queries
5. Consider adding /debug-last to registration script

VALIDATION METHODOLOGY
----------------------
1. Static code analysis of all source files
2. Test execution (199 tests, all passing)
3. Documentation review (README, RUNBOOK, guides)
4. Cross-reference validation (docs vs. code)
5. Security review (redaction, auth, validation)
6. Workflow analysis (OIDC, correlation, output)

EVIDENCE LOCATION
-----------------
Full evidence with code pointers, line numbers, and detailed analysis
is available in: MASS_PHASE_VALIDATION_REPORT.md

NEXT STEPS
----------
The orchestrator is ready for production use. All phases are complete
and operational. No further implementation required for Phases 1-5.

Consider:
1. Deploying to production environment
2. Configuring feature flags (ENABLE_ALERTS, ENABLE_DEBUG_CMD)
3. Setting up admin allowlists
4. Configuring CloudWatch dashboards
5. Planning Phase 6+ features (if any)
