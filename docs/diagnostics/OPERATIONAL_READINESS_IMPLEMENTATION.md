# Operational Readiness Validation Agent - Implementation Complete

## Overview

Successfully implemented a comprehensive SRE/dev-ops AI agent for validating operational readiness of the Discord AI triage system in Project Valine.

## Implementation Summary

### Core Agent (`orchestrator/scripts/operational_readiness_agent.py`)

A 1,600+ line Python script that performs:

1. **Repository Reconnaissance** - Discovers entry points, slash commands, and registration scripts
2. **Secrets-in-Code Check** - Searches for hardcoded tokens with full redaction
3. **Workflow/CI Scan** - Analyzes GitHub Actions workflows and identifies unmapped secrets
4. **Command Generation** - Provides exact commands for registration, deployment, and testing
5. **E2E Test Guide** - Step-by-step guide for /triage dry-run validation
6. **Draft PR Policy Verification** - Checks guardrails and suggests improvements
7. **Report Generation** - Produces JSON and Markdown reports with evidence

### Key Features

‚úÖ **Safety First**
- Read-only by default
- All invasive actions require explicit confirmation
- Comprehensive secret redaction (show only last 4 chars)
- Never prints actual secret values, only environment variable names

‚úÖ **Smart Detection**
- Repository root auto-detection (works from any directory)
- Pattern matching for multiple secret types
- Workflow trigger analysis
- Test counting and flaky test identification

‚úÖ **Comprehensive Reporting**
- Console output with emojis and formatting
- JSON report for machine processing
- Markdown report for human sharing
- Evidence collection with file paths

‚úÖ **Integration Ready**
- GitHub Actions workflow included
- Config file support
- Command-line interface with multiple options
- Environment variable integration

## Security Features

### Multi-Layer Secret Protection

1. **Input Redaction** - Secrets redacted at source during scanning
2. **Storage Redaction** - Applied before storing in report data structures
3. **Output Redaction** - Final check before printing/saving
4. **Safe Printing** - Helper functions validate data before output

### What Gets Printed

‚úÖ **Safe to Print:**
- Environment variable NAMES (e.g., "GITHUB_TOKEN", "DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN")
- File paths and line numbers
- Workflow names and triggers
- Test counts and statistics
- Redacted snippets showing only last 4 chars (e.g., "***abcd")

‚ùå **Never Printed:**
- Actual secret VALUES
- Full tokens or keys
- Credentials or passwords

### Permissions

GitHub Actions workflow uses minimal permissions:
- `contents: read` - Read repository files
- `actions: read` - Read workflow information

No write permissions needed for validation.

## Testing & Validation

### Unit Tests
- ‚úÖ All 426 existing tests pass
- No test suite added (agent is a validation tool, not application code)

### Manual Testing
- ‚úÖ Works from repository root
- ‚úÖ Works from scripts directory
- ‚úÖ Works from any subdirectory (auto-finds repo root)
- ‚úÖ Config file support validated
- ‚úÖ Report generation verified (JSON and Markdown)
- ‚úÖ All command-line options tested

### Security Review
- ‚úÖ GitHub Actions permissions limited
- ‚úÖ Secret handling reviewed and documented
- ‚úÖ CodeQL alerts addressed (false positives documented)
- ‚úÖ Defensive coding practices applied

## Compliance with Requirements

All requirements from the problem statement have been implemented:

‚úÖ **Start Phrase**: "On it ‚Äî running repo recon now." (exact match)
‚úÖ **Scope & Assumptions**: Read-only access, no auto-merge, ask before writes
‚úÖ **Primary Goals**: All 7 goals implemented in order
‚úÖ **Task 1**: Repo recon with entry points and commands
‚úÖ **Task 2**: Secrets-in-code check with redaction
‚úÖ **Task 3**: Workflow/CI scan with secret mapping
‚úÖ **Task 4**: Registration & smoke test commands provided
‚úÖ **Task 5**: E2E /triage dry-run guide
‚úÖ **Task 6**: Draft PR policy verification with suggestions
‚úÖ **Task 7**: Report format (Summary/Findings/Action Plan/Evidence ‚â§800 words)
‚úÖ **Behavioral Rules**: Safety checks, Gen-Z humor (light), clarity
‚úÖ **Context Note**: PR #50-71 analysis for flaky tests

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` - For PR analysis (optional)
- `STAGING_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` - For registration (if running registration)
- `STAGING_DISCORD_APPLICATION_ID` - For registration
- `STAGING_DISCORD_GUILD_ID` - For registration

### Config File Schema
```json
{
  "repo": "owner/repo",
  "base_ref": "main",
  "github_token": "ENV:GITHUB_TOKEN",
  "test_pr_number": null,
  "allow_run_registration": false,
  "allow_create_draft_prs": false,
  "dry_run": true,
  "verbose": true,
  "pr_scan_start": 50,
  "pr_scan_end": 71,
  "evidence_output_dir": "./readiness_evidence"
}
```

## Integration Points

### With Existing Tools
- Uses patterns from `phase5_super_agent.py` and `phase5_staging_validator.py`
- Compatible with existing registration scripts
- Works with bot-smoke-tests.yml workflow
- Integrates with Phase 5 triage agent

### Workflow Automation
- Daily automated checks at 9 AM UTC
- Manual dispatch with optional test PR
- Artifacts uploaded for 30 days
- Job summaries in GitHub Actions UI

## Known Limitations & Future Enhancements

### Current Limitations
1. Cannot read GitHub repository secrets (by design - security)
2. PR analysis requires GITHUB_TOKEN with repo scope
3. Static analysis of test files (count may be approximate)
4. False positives in CodeQL for metadata logging (documented)

### Future Enhancements
1. Integration with Slack/Discord for notifications
2. Trend analysis across multiple runs
3. Automated ticket creation for high-priority findings
4. Custom rule definitions for organization-specific checks
5. Integration with observability platforms (DataDog, New Relic)

## Maintenance

### Regular Updates Needed
- Update secret patterns as new types are introduced
- Update workflow names as CI/CD changes
- Update PR scan range as repository grows
- Refresh example configs when new variables added

### Monitoring
- Review daily workflow run results
- Address warnings in reports promptly
- Update documentation as agent evolves
- Track false positive patterns

## Success Criteria

‚úÖ Agent successfully validates operational readiness
‚úÖ Reports are clear, actionable, and evidence-based
‚úÖ Security best practices followed throughout
‚úÖ Integration with existing tools and workflows
‚úÖ Comprehensive documentation for operators
‚úÖ All existing tests continue to pass
