# Phase 5 Staging Validator - Executive Summary

**Date:** October 16, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Complete and Ready for Use  
**Agent:** Phase 5 Staging Validator and Flag Manager

---

## Overview

A comprehensive staging validation agent has been implemented to safely validate Phase 5 (observability + alerts) features in staging environments. This agent automates feature flag management, evidence collection, and validation reporting.

## Key Deliverables

### 1. Staging Validator Agent (`orchestrator/scripts/phase5_staging_validator.py`)

**Capabilities:**
- Automated feature flag management (debug commands, alerts)
- Safe staging environment validation
- Evidence collection from CloudWatch logs
- Production channel detection and blocking
- Validation report generation

**Commands:**
- `preflight` - Pre-validation safety checks
- `enable-debug` - Enable /debug-last command
- `enable-alerts` - Enable Discord alerts
- `disable-alerts` - Disable alerts (safety)
- `validate-debug` - Validate debug command
- `validate-alerts` - Validate alerts with rate-limiting
- `collect-logs` - Collect CloudWatch evidence
- `full-validation` - Complete end-to-end validation

### 2. GitHub Actions Workflow (`.github/workflows/phase5-staging-validation.yml`)

**Features:**
- Manual dispatch with validation type selection
- Automated weekly validation (Mondays 9 AM UTC)
- Evidence artifact upload (30-day retention)
- Validation summary in GitHub Actions

**Integration:**
- AWS OIDC authentication
- Secrets-based configuration
- Automated report generation

### 3. Documentation Suite

**Files Created:**
- `orchestrator/scripts/README.md` - Complete validator documentation (400+ lines)
- `orchestrator/scripts/QUICKSTART.md` - 5-minute quick start guide (300+ lines)
- `orchestrator/scripts/staging_config.example.json` - Example configuration
- `PHASE5_VALIDATION.md` - Updated with validator documentation

### 4. Test Suite (26 Unit Tests)

**Coverage:**
- Configuration loading and validation
- Evidence collection and tracking
- Preflight safety checks
- Feature flag management
- CloudWatch log collection
- Validation report generation

**Results:** 225 total tests (199 existing + 26 new), all passing ✅

---

## Safety Features

### Production Protection
- ✅ Detects production channel IDs ("prod", "production")
- ✅ Blocks execution if production environment detected
- ✅ Requires explicit staging configuration

### Validation Safeguards
- ✅ Preflight checks before any modifications
- ✅ Required configuration verification
- ✅ AWS CLI availability checks
- ✅ Lambda function existence verification

### Evidence and Audit Trail
- ✅ Structured JSON logging with correlation IDs
- ✅ Test result tracking (pass/fail/skip)
- ✅ CloudWatch log collection
- ✅ Validation reports with timestamps

---

## Usage Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Initial Staging Validation (5 minutes)

**Operator Actions:**
1. Generate configuration: `python phase5_staging_validator.py generate-config`
2. Edit configuration with staging values
3. Run preflight: `python phase5_staging_validator.py preflight --config staging_config.json`
4. Run full validation: `python phase5_staging_validator.py full-validation --config staging_config.json`

**Output:**
- Validation report in `validation_evidence/`
- Evidence of debug command functionality
- Evidence of alert posting with rate-limiting
- CloudWatch logs collected

### Scenario 2: Enable Debug Command in Staging

**Operator Actions:**
1. Run: `python phase5_staging_validator.py enable-debug --config staging_config.json`
2. Wait 30 seconds for Lambda propagation
3. Test in Discord: `/diagnose` then `/debug-last`

**Safety:**
- Debug command only enabled in staging
- Production remains with `ENABLE_DEBUG_CMD=false`
- Operator can disable anytime

### Scenario 3: Enable Alerts with Testing

**Operator Actions:**
1. Run: `python phase5_staging_validator.py enable-alerts --config staging_config.json --channel-id STAGING_CHANNEL`
2. Wait 30 seconds for propagation
3. Trigger controlled failure
4. Verify alert posted
5. Trigger same failure (verify rate-limited)

**Safety:**
- Alerts only sent to staging channel
- Production channel detection blocks accidental production alerts
- Rate-limiting prevents alert storms

### Scenario 4: Weekly Automated Validation

**Setup:** None required (GitHub Actions scheduled)

**Execution:**
- Runs automatically every Monday at 9 AM UTC
- Preflight checks verify configuration
- Collects evidence and generates report
- Uploads artifacts for review

**Output:**
- GitHub Actions summary with validation results
- Evidence artifacts retained for 30 days

## Validation Workflow

### Phase 1: Preparation (5 minutes)
1. Generate configuration
2. Review and edit with staging values
3. Run preflight checks
4. Verify configuration accepted

### Phase 2: Debug Command Validation (10 minutes)
1. Enable debug command
2. Wait for Lambda propagation
3. Execute `/diagnose` in Discord
4. Execute `/debug-last` in Discord
5. Verify ephemeral response
6. Verify trace ID and steps
7. Verify secret redaction
8. Collect CloudWatch logs
9. Document evidence

### Phase 3: Alerts Validation (15 minutes)
1. Disable alerts (safety)
2. Enable alerts with staging channel
3. Wait for propagation
4. Trigger controlled failure
5. Verify alert posted
6. Verify alert format (emoji, trace ID, links)
7. Verify no secrets in alert
8. Trigger same failure again
9. Verify rate-limiting (no duplicate)
