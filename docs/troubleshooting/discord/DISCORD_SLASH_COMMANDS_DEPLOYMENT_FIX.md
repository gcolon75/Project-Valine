# Discord Slash Commands Deployment Fix - Implementation Summary

## Problem Statement

Discord slash commands were registered and showing up in Discord autocomplete, but when users tried to execute them (like `/triage`, `/status`, etc.), they received "The application did not respond" error.

## Root Cause

This was not a code issue - the handler code exists and is correct. The problem was a **deployment and configuration issue** with several potential causes:

1. Lambda function not deployed to AWS
2. Discord Interactions Endpoint URL not configured
3. Discord Public Key mismatch between Discord Portal and Lambda environment
4. Missing environment variables in Lambda configuration

## What Users Need to Do

### If Commands Don't Respond:

#### Option 1: Automated Diagnosis (Recommended)
```bash
cd orchestrator
python scripts/validate_deployment.py --stage dev
```

Follow the specific fixes the script recommends.

#### Option 2: Quick Manual Fix

1. **Check Lambda is deployed:**
   ```bash
   aws lambda list-functions --query 'Functions[?contains(FunctionName, `valine-orchestrator`)]'
   ```
   If missing: `cd orchestrator && sam build && sam deploy`

2. **Check Interactions Endpoint URL:**
   - Go to Discord Developer Portal > Your App > General Information
   - Verify "Interactions Endpoint URL" is set
   - Should show green checkmark "Valid"
   - If not set, get URL from: `aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name valine-orchestrator --query 'Stacks[0].Outputs[?OutputKey==\`DiscordWebhookUrl\`].OutputValue'`

3. **Verify Public Key:**
   - Get from Lambda: `aws lambda get-function-configuration --function-name valine-orchestrator-discord-dev --query 'Environment.Variables.DISCORD_PUBLIC_KEY'`
   - Compare with Discord Portal > General Information > Public Key
   - Must match exactly
   - If different: Update `samconfig.toml` and redeploy

#### Option 3: Follow Quick Fix Guide

See `orchestrator/DISCORD_NO_RESPONSE_QUICKFIX.md` for step-by-step instructions.
