# Header/Footer Component Inventory
# Created: 2025-11-04
# Purpose: Document all header/footer implementations for marketing page modernization

headers:
  - name: "AppLayout Header"
    path: "src/layouts/AppLayout.jsx"
    type: "modern"
    usage:
      - "Authenticated app pages (dashboard, profile, discover, etc.)"
    characteristics:
      - "Modern glassmorphism design with backdrop blur"
      - "Green brand color gradient (#474747 to #0CCE6B)"
      - "Mic icon in gradient box as logo"
      - "Uses lucide-react icons"
      - "Fixed position with border-bottom"
      - "Includes ThemeToggle (to be removed from header per requirements)"
    notes: "This is the NEW MODERN HEADER - matches green brand and modern layout"
    decision: "Use this design pattern for marketing page header"

  - name: "Home.jsx Inline Header"
    path: "src/pages/Home.jsx"
    type: "marketing"
    usage:
      - "Landing page / marketing home page"
    characteristics:
      - "Inline header (lines 10-45)"
      - "Similar modern design to AppLayout"
      - "Green brand gradient logo"
      - "Includes ThemeToggle in nav (line 31)"
      - "Contains Sign In link"
      - "Fixed position with glassmorphism"
    notes: "Currently marketing page has its own inline header - should be extracted to reusable component"
    decision: "Keep this modern header but remove ThemeToggle from it"

  - name: "Header Component"
    path: "src/components/Header.jsx"
    type: "legacy"
    usage:
      - "Not currently used in main app"
      - "May be legacy from earlier implementation"
    characteristics:
      - "Simple top border design"
      - "Text-based 'Valine' branding (not gradient)"
      - "NavLink based navigation"
      - "No glassmorphism"
    notes: "Legacy component - candidate for archive"
    decision: "Mark as candidate-archive, do not use"

  - name: "NavBar Component"
    path: "src/components/NavBar.jsx"
    type: "legacy"
    usage:
      - "Not currently used in main app"
      - "References 'Joint' brand name (old brand)"
    characteristics:
      - "Uses old 'Joint' branding"
      - "Inline styles instead of Tailwind classes"
      - "Auth controls (login/logout)"
      - "Keyboard shortcuts support"
    notes: "Legacy component with old brand name - candidate for archive"
    decision: "Mark as candidate-archive, do not use"

footers:
  - name: "Home.jsx Inline Footer"
    path: "src/pages/Home.jsx"
    type: "marketing-modern"
    usage:

      - "Dark theme footer (bg-[#1a1a1a])"
      - "Multi-column layout with brand, product, resources"
      - "Social media links (Twitter, LinkedIn, GitHub)"
      - "Green hover states (#0CCE6B)"
      - "Comprehensive link structure"
    notes: "Modern, well-designed footer for marketing pages"
    decision: "Keep this footer on marketing page - it's the NEW footer"

  - name: "Footer Component"
    path: "src/components/Footer.jsx"
    type: "simple"
    usage:
      - "Not currently used in main app"
      - "May be legacy or for other pages"
    characteristics:
      - "Very simple copyright footer"
      - "Single line, centered text"
      - "Minimal design"
    notes: "Simple footer component - candidate for archive or use on simple pages"
    decision: "Mark as legacy-simple, not needed for marketing page"

  - name: "MarketingLayout Footer"
    path: "src/layouts/MarketingLayout.jsx"
    type: "legacy"
    usage:
      - "MarketingLayout component (line 18-20)"
      - "Currently NOT used as Home.jsx has inline header/footer"
    characteristics:
      - "Very minimal: 'Joint — the creative collab network.'"
      - "Uses old 'Joint' brand name"
    notes: "Legacy footer in unused layout - candidate for archive"
    decision: "Mark as candidate-archive, do not use"

layouts:
  - name: "MarketingLayout"
    path: "src/layouts/MarketingLayout.jsx"
    usage:
      - "Defined in routes but Home.jsx doesn't use it (has inline header/footer)"
    characteristics:
      - "Simple nav with 'Joint' branding"
      - "Basic footer"
      - "Minimal styling"
    notes: "This layout is defined in routes but Home.jsx overrides it with inline header/footer"
    decision: "Consider deprecating or updating, but NOT using for this project"

  - name: "AppLayout"
    path: "src/layouts/AppLayout.jsx"
    usage:
      - "All authenticated app pages"
    characteristics:
      - "Modern glassmorphism header"
      - "No footer (authenticated app doesn't need footer)"
      - "Navigation with icons and badges"
    notes: "This is the modern design pattern to follow"
    decision: "Use this as design reference for marketing header"
