```
/triage pr:58 auto_fix:true
```
**Result:** Creates fix PR automatically

### Invasive Auto-Fix
```
/triage pr:58 auto_fix:true allow_invasive:true
```
**Result:** Creates fix PR with no file limits

## 🎓 What Was Learned

### Technical Insights

1. **Discord Integration**
   - Slash commands are instant (guild-level)
   - 60 second propagation delay required
   - Proper option types critical

2. **Triage Agent Reuse**
   - Existing agent is well-architected
   - Easy to integrate programmatically
   - Config-based approach flexible

3. **Testing Patterns**
   - Mock-based testing very effective
   - Test all error paths
   - Verify trace/audit logging

### Best Practices

1. **Minimal Changes**
   - Only touched 4 existing files
   - Created 3 new files (tests + docs)
   - No breaking changes

2. **Surgical Precision**
   - Added exactly what was needed
   - Preserved all existing functionality
   - Minimal diff size

3. **Comprehensive Testing**
   - 7 new tests cover all scenarios
   - All existing tests still pass
   - Security scan clean
